Problem Summary
During the VPC project, I encountered several challenges:

SSH Permissions:

I struggled to SSH into the bastion server due to incorrect permissions on the key pair file.
Initial Access Issues:

My first attempt to SSH into the two servers failed. I launched a simple HTML page on server 1, but it didnâ€™t work, prompting me to terminate everything.
Bastion Server Placement:

In my second attempt, I mistakenly created the bastion server in the private subnet, which prevented SSH access.
Port Confusion:

I initially launched the web server on port 8000 but had only allowed traffic on port 80. After realizing this, I changed the web server configuration to use port 80.
Load Balancer Health Issues:

After successfully launching two websites on the private servers and setting up the load balancer, one website showed as unhealthy. I accessed it via SSH to correct the issue.
Despite these challenges, I successfully completed my project, launching two operational websites on the private servers.
