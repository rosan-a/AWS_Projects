# AWS Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Demo

This guide outlines the process of setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS using GitHub as the source control for a Python application. We will leverage AWS CodeBuild for building and testing our application, AWS CodeDeploy for deploying it, and AWS CodePipeline for orchestrating the entire process. This setup ensures an efficient and automated workflow for deploying your application whenever there are changes in the codebase.

---

## Step 1: Configure AWS CodeBuild

First, we need to set up AWS CodeBuild, which will handle the building and testing of our Python application:

1. In the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), navigate to **CodeBuild** and click **Create build project**.
2. **Project settings**:
   - Enter a name for your build project.
3. **Source**:
   - Choose **GitHub** as the source provider, and connect your GitHub account.
   - Select your repository and branch.
4. **Build environment**:
   - Specify the operating system, runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python), and compute resources needed for your application.
5. **Build commands**:
   - Specify your build commands in a `buildspec.yml` file to define tasks such as installing dependencies and running tests. Hereâ€™s an example for a Python application:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2
   phases:
     install:
       commands:
         - echo "Installing dependencies..."
         - pip install -r requirements.txt
     build:
       commands:
         - echo "Running tests..."
         - pytest
         - echo "Building application..."
   artifacts:
     files:
       - '**/*'
   ```
6. Review your settings and click **Create build project**.

Now, CodeBuild is set up to build and test your application.

## Step 2: Set Up AWS CodeDeploy

Next, we will configure AWS CodeDeploy to handle the deployment of our application:

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to **CodeDeploy** and click **Create application**.
2. **Application settings**:
   - Enter a name for your application and select the compute platform (e.g., EC2/On-premises, Lambda).
3. **Deployment group**:
   - Click **Create deployment group**.
   - Enter a name for your deployment group.
   - Configure the deployment settings, such as selecting the EC2 instances or target Lambda functions to deploy to.
4. **Deployment configuration**:
   - Choose a deployment configuration (e.g., CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime).
5. **Service role**:
   - Create or select an IAM role that allows CodeDeploy to interact with your AWS resources.
6. Review your settings and click **Create application**.

With CodeDeploy configured, you are ready to deploy your application.

## Step 3: Create an AWS CodePipeline

Finally, we will create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the CI/CD process:

1. In the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), navigate to **CodePipeline** and click **Create pipeline**.
2. **Pipeline settings**:
   - Provide a name for your pipeline.
   - Choose an IAM role (or allow AWS to create one).
3. **Source stage**:
   - Select **GitHub** as the source provider.
   - Connect your GitHub account, select your repository, and specify the branch.
4. **Build stage**:
   - Choose **AWS CodeBuild** as the build provider.
   - Select the CodeBuild project you created in Step 1.
5. **Deploy stage**:
   - Select **AWS CodeDeploy** as the deployment provider.
   - Choose the application and deployment group you created in Step 2.
6. Review your pipeline configuration and click **Create pipeline**.

Once the pipeline is created, it will automatically trigger whenever there are changes to your specified GitHub branch.

## Step 4: Trigger the CI/CD Process

Now that the CI/CD pipeline is set up, you can trigger the process by making changes to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository and make a change (e.g., update a file).
2. Commit and push your changes to the configured branch.
3. Navigate to **CodePipeline** in the AWS Console. You should see the pipeline begin to execute automatically.

CodePipeline will pull the latest code, initiate CodeBuild for building and testing, and proceed to deploy your application using CodeDeploy.

By following these steps, you now have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline on AWS! This setup allows for seamless updates to your application, ensuring that the latest version is always deployed to your environment.
